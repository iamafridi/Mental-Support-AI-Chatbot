# Mental Support Chat Bot

## Overview
I have created the **Mental Support Chat Bot**, an interactive console-based application designed to provide emotional support and guidance to users facing various mental health challenges. Built using Java and the Maven build system, this chatbot strives to create a friendly and understanding environment where users can freely express their feelings and receive tailored responses based on keyword recognition.

While the bot primarily operates through a set of predefined responses linked to specific keywords, it encourages open dialogue by prompting users to elaborate on their feelings and experiences. This project underscores the importance of accessibility and support in mental health, making it easier for individuals to engage in conversations about their emotional well-being.

The **Mental Support Chat Bot** serves as a valuable tool for mental health support, facilitating interactive conversations that offer empathetic feedback and guidance tailored to a range of emotions and situations. By fostering a safe space for dialogue, this application aims to help users navigate their feelings and connect with the support they need.
